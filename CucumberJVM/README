CucumberJVM is a cucumber implementation using Java based step definitions. It provides a BDD tool that supports expressing tests in natural language in the format Given/When/Then. These natural language statements are connected to code that automates the tests in the step files.

You can find additional information about CucumberJVM at https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm, and additional information about Cucumber at http://cukes.info/

This example was created by Markus GÃ¤rtner.

To run these tests:
1. make sure you have java installed.
3. cd to the CucumberJVM directory
